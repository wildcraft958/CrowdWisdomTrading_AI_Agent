# CROWDWISDOM TRADING INTELLIGENCE REPORT
Generated: 2025-09-06 23:23:15

## üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
‚Ä¢ Analyzed 10 symbols (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, META, NFLX, AMD, CRM)
‚Ä¢ Monitored 10 financial influencers
‚Ä¢ Recent insider activity: 1 buys, 15 sells (2,250 vs 37,000 shares)
‚Ä¢ Historical comparison: 95.1% decrease in filing activity
‚Ä¢ Social sentiment: Negative (-0.21) across platforms
‚Ä¢ Risk assessment: Medium risk with bearish indicators

## üéØ KEY FINDINGS
